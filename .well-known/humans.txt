Documentation: See README.md, claude.md
License: MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 (dual)
Last Update: 2025-11-22
Version: 0.1.0
Status: Phase 1 MVP Complete

/* PRINCIPLES */

Safety-first: Zero unsafe blocks, formal rules for critical decisions
Privacy-first: Offline-by-default, local inference prioritized
Type-safe: Rust ownership model, compile-time guarantees
Memory-safe: No manual memory management, no use-after-free
Accessible: Works on 2-4GB RAM devices
Transparent: Open source, explainable routing decisions
Sustainable: Minimal dependencies, battery-aware design

/* INSPIRATION */

This project addresses "context switching hell" across 60+ projects.
It combines:
  - Liquid state machines (reservoir computing)
  - Small language models (1-3B parameters)
  - Rule-based expert systems
  - Intelligent routing (local vs. cloud)
  - Offline-first philosophy

The goal: AI assistance that preserves privacy, works offline,
and helps manage hyperkinetic multi-project workflows.

/* RELATED PROJECTS */

Echomesh: Conversation context preservation
Oblíbený: Safety-critical language with formal verification
UPM: Universal Project Manager
CADRE: Distributed state via CRDTs
Academic Workflow Suite: Research paper management
SaltRover: Field robotics with offline SLAM
