   - Transparency in modification history
   - Respect for previous contributors
   - Recognition that code is iterative and collaborative
   - Embrace of software's temporal and evolving nature

ADDITIONAL NOTES
=================================================================================

**Why Dual License?**

This project uses dual licensing to maximize freedom and compatibility:

- **MIT License**: Widely recognized, minimal restrictions, corporate-friendly
- **Palimpsest License**: Emphasizes attribution and philosophical alignment
  with the iterative, layered nature of software development

**For Contributors:**

By contributing to this project, you agree to license your contributions under
the same dual license terms (MIT + Palimpsest v0.8).

**For Users:**

You may choose either license. If you need to comply with corporate policies
that only recognize OSI-approved licenses, use the MIT License. If you appreciate
the philosophical principles of Palimpsest, you may choose that instead.

**License Selection:**

No action is required. Both licenses grant you permission. Simply comply with
the terms of whichever license you prefer.

**Attribution Example:**

When using this software, proper attribution might look like:

  "Built with Mobile AI Orchestrator by Jonathan Bowman (Hyperpolymath)
   https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/heterogenous-mobile-computing
   Licensed under MIT + Palimpsest v0.8"
